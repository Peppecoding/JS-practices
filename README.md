# Programming Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to storing various programming practice files. Each file represents a different algorithm or coding challenge I have worked on to enhance my programming skills. The repository serves as a personal library of coding examples and exercises.

## Contents

This repository includes the following files and examples:

- `fibonacci_v1.js` - A JavaScript implementation of the Fibonacci sequence generator, allowing customization of the sequence length. Supports generating sequences with only the first number or the first two numbers of the Fibonacci series.

- `fibonacci_v2.js` - A refined version of the Fibonacci sequence generator, optimized for clarity and performance. Suitable for generating longer sequences efficiently.

## Usage

To run any of the JavaScript files in this repository, you will need Node.js installed on your computer. You can execute a script by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node <filename.js>
